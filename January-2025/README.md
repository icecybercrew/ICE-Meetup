## Summary
In this meetup, we provided a brief introduction to the Hack The Box platform, as most participants were new to it. We conducted a walkthrough of the Shoppy machine on Hack The Box to introduce participants to Red Teaming concepts. Simultaneously, we offered Brutus (Sherlock) to those interested in Blue Teaming so they could try it out.
Participants were also treated to free food and stickers, making the session more engaging. We concluded the event with a lucky draw, awarding:
- Three 1-Month VIP+ Hack The Box Lab subscriptions.
- Three sets of 500 cubes for Hack The Box Academy.
