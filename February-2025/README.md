# 15 February 2025

## Summary
This meetup was held in collaboration with [Cyberhax](https://cyberhaxutp.github.io/official-website/) at UTP. In this meetup, we provided a brief introduction to the Hack The Box platform, as most participants were new to it. We shared how attacker approach their victim and the "legal" pentesting methodology. Participants were also treated to free food and stickers, making the session more engaging. We concluded the event with a lucky draw, awarding:
- Three 1-Month VIP+ Hack The Box Lab subscriptions.
- Three sets of 500 cubes for Hack The Box Academy.
- Three 25GBP SwagCards
- One ProLabs Voucher
